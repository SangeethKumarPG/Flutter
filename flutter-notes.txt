We need to install Bracket Pair Color DLW, Flutter tree, Dart and Flutter extension for Visual Studio Code.

To crate a project we need to use the following command in the terminal:

flutter create project_name

The project name should be in snake_case.

To run the project cd into the project directory and use the following command:
flutter run
This will show the options, choose the relevant option and the project will run.

After creating a project inside the lib folder we create a new dart file and start writing code.

To create a stateless widget we type the st keyword which will generate the boilerplate code for a stateless widget.

We modify the class name. We need to return the Scaffold() widget to display a static page/screen.

Inside the Scaffold() we add the appBar and body property.

Inisde body we add the child property which is the widget that we want to display on the screen.

The following is an example for a stateless widget
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class Page1 extends StatelessWidget {
  const Page1({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          backgroundColor:const  Color.fromARGB(255, 120, 200, 120),
          title: const Text("My First Page",
              style: TextStyle(
                  fontFamily: 'Montserrat',
                  fontSize: 24,
                  fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
              centerTitle: true,
              leading: IconButton(onPressed: (){}, color: Colors.red, icon : const Icon(Icons.person_2_outlined))
        ),
        body: SafeArea(
            child: Column(
          children: [
            TextButton(onPressed: () {}, child: const Text("Button 1"))
          ],
        )));
  }
}

There are two types of Buttons in Flutter, TextButton and ElevatedButton.
IconButton is used to display an icon on the appBar.

We can add actions and leading in the appBar to add actions to the appBar.
The leading property is used to display an icon on the left side of the appBar.
The actions property is used to display actions on the right side of the appBar.
The actions is a list which we can other widgets like TextButton or IconButton.
To make the debug icon disapper in the appBar we can set the debugShowCheckedModeBanner to false in the MaterialApp widget in main.dart file.

To add images to the project first we need to go to the pubspec.yaml file and add uncomment the assets section.
NOTE that you should not adjust the space of the contents in the pubspec.yaml file.

Then create an assets folder in the root of the project and add the images to the assets folder.

To use the images in the project we can use the following code:
Image(
  image:AssetImage('assets/image_name.png')
  // optionally adjust the width and height of the image
  ,width: 200,
   height: 200,
)
